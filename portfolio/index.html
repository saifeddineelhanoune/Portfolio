            <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p>after being a student at 42Circulium i enhance my skills in low-level and C/CPP programming, 
                with a particular focus on imperative programming, linear/reactive programming, and graphics in low-level programming. 
                This decision was driven by the need to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of programming and to stay updated with the latest developments in the field
                I pursued advanced courses in low-level programming, focusing on mastering the C language and understanding its intricacies. 
                I worked on various projects that required a deep understanding of memory management, data structures, and algorithms
                This academic journey has been a success, as it has not only improved my programming skills but also broadened my understanding of the intricacies of programming languages. 
                I am now better equipped to tackle more complex programming challenges and am confident in my ability to adapt to the evolving demands of the tech industry</p>
